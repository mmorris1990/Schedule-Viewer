## Production Schedule Viewer

A simplified schedule viewer designed to prioritize production flow for a manufacturing company with multiple departments.

# Intended Use/benefit 

This application is being designed specifically for the large-format print shop Endless Edge, which utilizes an Excel Spreadsheet schedule to maintain work flow and due dates. There are always a large number of jobs in multiple steps of the production process and keeping workflow organized within a group of people with just a spreadhseet can be difficult. This application will list the most high priority jobs by syncing a database with the schedule as it is updated, and show a range of information about upcoming jobs as well as department specific tasks that need completing.

For the purposes of the class, this application will start with an account for the Finishing Department, the last step of production before a job order is fulfilled. There will be a large tv screen that is easily viewable to the entire department showing that day's hot jobs. There will also be a component showing jobs due the next day, and tasks that need to be completed outside of the main schedule.

A user will be able to cross out jobs or tasks as they are completed, and add new department specific tasks. There will be account login and authorization to link that department's account with the relevant tasks.
